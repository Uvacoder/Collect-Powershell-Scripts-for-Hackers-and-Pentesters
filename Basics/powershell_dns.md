### Using Powershell to query DNS Information

PowerShell provides several functions and cmdlets that you can use to query DNS information. Here’s 
a list of some key functions and cmdlets related to DNS querying in PowerShell:

* Resolve-DnsName: This cmdlet is used to query DNS information, including resolving 
FQDNs to IP addresses and vice versa. It provides various query types, such as A (IPv4 address), 
AAAA (IPv6 address), MX, NS, and PTR (reverse lookup).

* Test-DnsServer: This cmdlet is specifically designed to test DNS servers for specific records. 
It helps you diagnose DNS server issues and verify the presence of DNS records.

* [System.Net.Dns]: PowerShell provides access to the .NET Framework’s System.Net.
Dns class, which contains static methods for querying DNS.

It’s important to note that some of these cmdlets and functions may require administrative privileges 
to perform certain DNS queries, especially for internal network resources. Also, keep in mind that the 
availability and behavior of these cmdlets and functions may vary based on your PowerShell version 
and the modules installed on your system.
