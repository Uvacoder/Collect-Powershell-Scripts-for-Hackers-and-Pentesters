  <b>ATTENCTION HERE : <br>This repository consists of several parts, and it is highly recommended that you do not skip any parts if you intend to use it as a blog.

PS-010 contains basic commands that are both fun and effective for attacking.

However, please note that the Ping-Play module needs to be updated, as some of the scripts in PS-010 may not work on the latest versions of Windows (e.g., WIN-11 and some WIN-10 versions). Therefore, it is crucial that you thoroughly check the scripts before launching an attack or approaching real-world targets.</b>
